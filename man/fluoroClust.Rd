\title{A function to cluster flow cytometry data by one fluorescence dimension in to "on" and "off" populations.}
\usage{
fluoroClust(fF, clust.type = "ICL", channel = "BL1-H", prior.max = 5,
  prior.min = 3, crude.threshold = 3.5, do.plot = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{fF}{a \code{\link[flowCore]{flowFrame}} to cluster.}

\item{clust.type}{choose a clustering method; "ICL" or "crude".}

\item{channel}{the fluorescence channel on which to cluster.}

\item{prior.max}{the expected location of the "on" peak.}

\item{prior.min}{the expected location of the "off" peak.}

\item{crude.threshold}{the threshold to use if the "crude" method is chosen.}

\item{do.plot}{a Boolean flag to determine whether to produce plots showing the trimming of each flowFrame. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{data.frame}} containing \code{num_samples}, the
number of samples clustered, \code{max_clust_mean}, the mean value of fluoresence
in the "on" cluster, and \code{max_clust_prop}, the proportion of the total
population that is "on".
}
\description{
Cluster data in a \code{\link[flowCore]{flowFrame}} using the \code{\link[flowClust]{flowClust}}
package. Given a fluorescence channel and, optionally, prior values for the on and off
peak locations, determines how many clusters there are and produces information on the populations.
